In this project, we have created the library.
The library has employees and Library members. 
Only employees have access to the library, but members can check-in and checkout books. 
They can check the book collection.
According to library criteria, our employees can help the member to check in and check out. 
Also, they can charge fees if a member lost their book. 
Our program we use GUI, LinkedList, ArrayList.
